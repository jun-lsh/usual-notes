# Bridging Real World Assets (RWA)

Usual wants to behave as a connector between RWAs in TradFi and DeFi by granting DeFi participants exposure to RWAs via its stablecoin, $USD0.

Essentially, it wants to create a 1:1 RWA collateralized stablecoin that has an associated governance token, $USUAL, as opposed to other similar stablecoins like $USDC and $USDT that have no such DeFi mechanisms besides the stablecoin itself. 

This is meant to target a specific shortcoming of existing fiat-backed stablecoins, namely that revenue from the collateral is privatized by the issuing organisation (Circle, Tether) whereas risk and losses are "socialized". The prominent example is the USDC depegging event due to SVB's collapse, and given that Circle held a portion of their collateral in SVB's reserves, this led to brief under-collateralization which also affected the market at large.
## Usual's Collateral Composition

Based on the factsheet provided on $USD0, the Usual collateral is exclusively backed by cash and cash equivalents e.g. short-maturity US T-Bills and reverse repos. The argument is by owning assets that closely mirror central bank money (M0), you reduce the systemic risks that commercial money has.

As it stands, however, instead of managing these assets themselves, this responsibility has instead by "subcontracted" to Hashnote's USYC and Ondo's USDY.

- Hashnote's USYC is backed by short-term reverse repo using US Gov backed securities
	- It provides a base yield of 4.739% stemming from Hashnote's Short Duration Yield Fund, and this is a risk-free return
- Ondo's USDY is backed by short-term US T-Bills and back demand deposits
	- It proves a base yield of 5.30%

The emphasis on short-maturity is to prevent force liquidation during significant redemptions.

Other collateral providers of interest are Backed, M^0, Spiko, Adapt3r and BlackRock.

**Basically, Usual would be able to round up all these other RWA backed stablecoin minters and "combine" them under the same banner of $USD0 to more easily expand their exposure to DeFi participants.**
## Minting and Redemption of $USD0

$USD0 is a "Liquid Deposit Token" (LDT), which just means its a non-productive token representing a 1:1 mint against the RWA collateral. They are redeemable at any time (usually, in limited size).
### Direct Minting and Redemption

Direct minting is facilitated via the Usual Counter, where depositing eligible RWA issues a 1:1 amount of USD0. As previously mentioned, these RWA are currently primarily represented by USYC. 

Direct redemption can later be performed by withdrawing the RWA underlying USD0 at the Usual Counter.
### Indirect Minting and Secondary Market Redemption

Indirect minting allows you to mint USD0 with other stablecoins such as USDC or USDT. This is thanks to a third party Collateral Provider that is willing to take USDC/USDT in exchange for eligible RWA collateral, which will then be provided to the Usual protocol.

Similarly, you can then sell USD0 for USDC/USDT on a secondary market, and since this USD0 can be subsequently fully redeemed at the Usual Counter, this means a 1:1 peg should be maintained via arbitrage.
## Collateral Risk Management

- Interest Rate Risk
	- Increases in interest rate would lead to decreases in returns on bonds, which may lead to losses when you liquidate fixed-income securities prior to maturity.
	- Mitigated by restricting RWAs to a duration of less than 0.5 years.
- Counterparty Risk
	- Usual's strategy is to limit the use of over-the-counter products and approving counterparties with a minimum average credit rating.
- Liquidity Risk
	- To facilitate efficient and effective redemption, all RWAs must permit redemptions with a max time frame of 5 days, and Usual will prefer tokenizers allowing same day redemptions (e.g. Hashnote)
- Avoids FX Risk by exclusively investing in USD assets of 100% FX hedged assets
- Avoids Credit Risk by avoiding corporate debt holdings entirely
- Usual will also manage an insurance fund which will behave as a safety net.
