# Future Works

Looking at their docs, we see that in the works includes:
- the Usual ATM
	- Seems to possibly be a real world ATM allow you to "spend Usual Assets" in everyday life
- the Usual Drugstore
	- There are no details on what this is supposed to be
- 
- other LDTs for Blue Chip crypto assets
## Future LDTs

The design of LDTs and LBTs can be applied to other assets besides RWAs, with the Usual team proposing other LDTs such as $ETH0, where we substitute the RWAs with staked ETH (so the interest earned on T-bills is replaced with the staking rewards).

With this in mind, assuming that $USUAL is still the LBT reward, then the valuation of $USUAL would be modified accordingly as it directly affects the TVL and basic yield.
