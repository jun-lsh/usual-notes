# Liquid Bond

Wrapping and locking of $USD0 will grant you the "Liquid Bond Token" (LBT) that is $USD0++, from which you will then gain access to either the α-yield in the form of $USUAL governance tokens or the base yield of the RWA.

Maturity period for $USD0++ is 4 years, after which the $USD0++ can be converted back to $USD0 at a 1:1 ratio. Prior to maturity, you can sell $USD0++ for $USD0 on a secondary market.

## Base Yield Opportunity

The base yield opportunity is just another way of saying risk free return from the RWAs, which is provided in $USD0 and distributed every 6 months. Redeeming the base yield return instead of the governance token return would mean forfeiting the α-yield over a locking period of choice. 

So if you lock your $USD0++ for 4 months, you will not be able to redeem any $USUAL that would have been accrued over that period, and you can redeem the base yield over those 4 months in $USD0. 

## α-yield

This is the main selling point, which is why you would be using $USD0 instead of swapping for $USYC or $USDY directly from Hashnote or Ondo.

The α-yield is the emission of the governance token $USUAL, which will be available to those that mint $USD0, lock up their $USD0 or LP in USD0/USD0++ or USD0/USDC pools.

In the public phase prior to the $USUAL TGE, this will instead by represented by Usual points or "pills", which can then later be redeemed for $USUAL.

The rewards are as follows:
- Instant Reward
	- 5 pills per $USD0++ minted
- Daily Rewards
	- 3 pills per $USD0++ held
	- 3+ pills per dollar of USD0/USD0++ LP'd 
	- 1 pill per dollar of USD0/USDC LP'd 

The emission schedule of $USUAL is inversely proportional to the TVL of the protocol in order to create a deflationary effect. Of course, as a governance token, holders will have governance over the Usual treasury, and 90% of all $USUAL tokens will be allocated to the community.

Utility of the $USUAL token will expand over time, and eventually you can stake $USUAL to gain further yield, etc.
