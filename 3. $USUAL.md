# Tokenomics

## Emission Schedule

- Following the TGE, the emission rate of $USUAL decreases as the TVL increases
	- This is to create a deflationary effect by "creating scarcity"
- $USUAL is minted when LBTs (\$USD0++) are minted, and the ratio corresponds to the current TVL and revenues of the protocol
- The rate in which the emission rate decreases is proportional to the TVL

## Distribution

90% of the tokens will be allocated to the community (stakers, LPs, LBT holders etc.) while the remaining 10% go towards "contributors". 

# Utility

## Staking Rewards

Stakers will convert their $USUAL tokens into $USUAL+ tokens, in which they will receive additional $USUAL as staking rewards (with the emission rate of these rewards following the above stated principles).

This staking reward is capped at 10% of all the newly minted $USUAL tokens.

Unstaking will incur a 5% fee to be deduced from the unstaked $USUAL+.

## Governance 

As a governance token, you will be able to participate in a DAO by voting on proposals. 

Proposed governance rights include:
- The ability to vote on protocol upgrades
- New LDT assets (such as $ETH0)
- Pools which receive incentives (liquidity allocation)
- Fees, collateral structures

# Valuation

As a speculative governance token, its valuation should be based on the earnings per token generated based on the DAO's revenue.

Given that the whole point is to be able to redistribute the risk free interest from the underlying RWA, this will be the intrinsic Earnings per Token through the absorption of TradFi revenue.

The Earnings per Token (EPT) can thus be directly calculated:

$$EPT = \frac{Yield_{collateral} + fees}{Supply($USUAL)}$$

However, we need to account for the deflationary aspect of the token as well, which is what would (in theory) bump up its valuation significantly.

The minting rate is decreased daily based on the increase in TVL through an inverse direct relationship. As such, the $Yield_{collateral}$ should be increasing with the TVL, but the $Supply(\$USUAL)$ will not be increasing proportionally and will continue to deviate, where it should eventually settle to be directly proportional to the growth of the TVL itself (as $\Delta Supply(\$USUAL)$ approaches 0).

Now, in order to produce a projection for the value of $USUAL, we will multiply this $EPT$ by the Price to Earnings Ratio. This is what would make the α-yield more inviting to participants rather than just claiming the basic yield rewards — this P/E multiplier would produce a higher APR. 

However, in DeFi,  we don't really have the means to calculate a P/E as there isn't a conception of "net profits" for a project, so instead the Usual team uses the more crypto-centric FDV/TVL ratio as a proxy, where in theory, we can emulate the FDV as
$$FDV = r \times TVL \times PE$$
Where $r$ is the risk free rate and $PE$ is the Price to Earnings Ratio. This is a direct computation by getting the earnings by evaluating the "profits" accrued from the basic TVL, then multiplying it to produce the Fully Diluted Value.

From this, we can manipulate to claim that
$$PE = \frac{1}{r} \times \frac{FDV}{TVL}$$

The Usual team has already calculated the historical data for us to produce a figure of an average FDV/TVL of 5, and given the basic risk-free interest on the RWAs to be ~5%, this would produce a P/E multiplier of x100.

The projected price is thus

$$p($USUAL) = PE \times EPT = \frac{1}{r} \times \frac{FDV}{TVL} \times \frac{Yield_{collateral} + fees}{Supply($USUAL)}$$

Assuming 2.1 Million $USUAL is minted pre-launch from a minted amount of $1M USD0, with a pre-launch TVL of $250M and an achievable FDV/TVL of 5, this would place the projected price of $USUAL at $0.50 per token, producing an APR of 188.55%.

Given that this isn't some CDP governance token like MKR, I think it can be expected that the value of $USUAL would not be violently affected by price changes in the crypto market at large since it's not collateralized by, say, ETH. Obviously, as a speculative token in the DeFi market, it would still be subject to the volatility present in the market, but I don't anticipate it to be able to maintain 3-digit APRs for long.
